crontab" command. Running  ---------->  "crontab -e"

1. You notice a sudden spike in server CPU utilization. How would you troubleshoot and identify the root cause?  
Ans:  
- Check CPU usage with `top` or `htop`.  
- Identify the culprit process using `ps` or `pidstat`.  
- Analyze logs for related events (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`).

---

2. A critical application on your Linux server is unresponsive. Walk me through the steps you would take to diagnose and resolve the issue.  
Ans:  
- Use `ps` or `top` to identify any unresponsive or hung processes.  
- Check application logs for any errors or failures (`/var/log/` or application-specific logs).  
- Restart the application or service using `systemctl restart <service_name>` or `kill -9 <PID>`.  
- Monitor system resources and logs for any improvements.

---

3. You need to deploy a new version of a web application on a Linux server without causing downtime. Explain the steps you would take to achieve a zero-downtime deployment.  
Ans:  
- Set up a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX).  
- Deploy the new version on one server at a time (rolling deployment).  
- Validate the new version is working before moving to the next server.  
- Once all servers have the new version, update the load balancer configuration.

---

4. A team member accidentally deleted important files on a Linux server. How would you recover the lost data?  
Ans:  
- Use file recovery tools like `extundelete` or `photorec` to attempt recovery.

- Restore from backups if available.

---

5. Your Linux server is running out of disk space. What steps would you take to identify and resolve the issue, considering both short-term and long-term solutions?

- Clean up unnecessary files or logs.  
- Implement log rotation (`logrotate`) to manage log sizes.  
- Consider adding additional storage or using cloud storage in the long-term.

---

6. Explain how you would set up and configure a basic firewall on a Linux server to enhance its security.  
Ans:  
- Use `iptables` or `firewalld` to define firewall rules.  
- Allow only necessary ports and services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SSH).  
- Set default policies to DROP for incoming traffic and ACCEPT for outgoing traffic.  
- Regularly review and update firewall rules based on security requirements.

---

7. Your team is working on a collaborative project, and you want to implement version control using Git on a Linux server. How would you set up and manage the Git repository?

- Initialize a new repository with `git init` in the project directory.  
- Commit files using `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.  
- Push to a central repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) using `git remote add origin <repo_url>`, followed by `git push -u origin main`.  
- Collaborate by using branches and pull requests.

---

8. You want to monitor the performance of your Linux server over time. What tools and techniques would you use for performance monitoring and analysis?  
Ans:  
- Use `sar`, `vmstat`, `iostat` to monitor system performance in real-time.  
- Set up `Prometheus` or `Nagios` for long-term monitoring and alerting.  
- Use `htop` or `atop` for detailed process-level monitoring.  
- Configure alerting thresholds for CPU, memory, and disk usage.

---

9. You are responsible for securing a Linux server. Outline the security measures and best practices you would implement to protect against potential threats.  
Ans:  
- Keep the system and software updated with `apt upgrade` or `yum update`.  
- Configure a firewall using `iptables` or `firewalld` and allow only necessary ports.  
- Implement strong user authentication (e.g., SSH keys, two-factor authentication).  
- Regularly audit and review system logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`).  
- Apply the principle of least privilege by restricting user access.  
- Disable unnecessary services with `systemctl disable <service_name>`.
