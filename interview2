                DEVOPS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS       
==================================================

1. What is DevOps and why is it important?
   DevOps is a set of practices that automates and integrates 
   processes between software development and IT teams to enhance 
   collaboration and efficiency. Itâ€™s important because it 
   shortens development cycles, increases deployment frequency, 
   and delivers reliable software faster.

2. Explain the difference between DevOps and Agile.
   Agile focuses on iterative development and collaboration 
   between teams (developers, QA, etc.) within the development 
   cycle, while DevOps extends that collaboration to include 
   operations, with an emphasis on continuous integration and 
   continuous delivery (CI/CD).

3. What are the key benefits of implementing DevOps?
   - Faster delivery of features
   - Improved collaboration between teams
   - More reliable and frequent releases
   - Better infrastructure management
   - Faster detection and resolution of issues

4. What are the main components of a DevOps pipeline?
   - Source control
   - Build automation
   - Testing
   - Deployment
   - Monitoring

5. What is the role of CI/CD in DevOps?
   CI/CD automates the process of integrating and deploying code 
   changes. It enables teams to continuously integrate code into 
   a shared repository (CI) and deploy that code to production or 
   other environments (CD).

6. How do you approach infrastructure as code (IaC)? 
   IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through 
   code, making it repeatable, versioned, and testable. Tools like 
   Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible are used for 
   implementing IaC.

   checks earlier in the development process to identify and fix 
   issues faster.

9. What is the difference between CI & CD?
   - CI (Continuous Integration) involves automating the integration 
     of code changes into a shared repository.
   - CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) automates the deployment 
     of changes to production or other environments.

10. How do you handle version control in a DevOps environment?
    Use tools like Git to maintain version control, ensuring all 
    code changes are tracked, branched, and merged effectively,
