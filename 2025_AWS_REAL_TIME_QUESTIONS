A Load Balancer (LB) is a service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers (EC2s, containers, etc.) to:

Improve availability

Increase scalability

Provide fault tolerance

Ensure faster response times


ðŸ§° Types of Load Balancers
1. Application Load Balancer (ALB) â€“ Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
Routes based on URL path, headers, query string, host

Best for microservices & REST APIs

Supports host-based and path-based routing

2. Network Load Balancer (NLB) â€“ Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
Very fast, handles millions of requests

Best for real-time gaming, video, TCP/UDP services

3. Classic Load Balancer (CLB) â€“ Deprecated, legacy
Basic LB for EC2, both Layer 4 & 7 support (limited features)

4. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) â€“ For third-party appliances
Used for firewall, intrusion detection, traffic inspection
